                    Welcome to Know Your Tank. When I first started out in the world of marine biology and fish keeping, there were so many terms,
                    factors and calculations that I just did not understand. It took hours of research to find the information I needed and why each
                    was important. The hardest thing I found was not having one resource that contained all the information you needed r was able to
                    direct you to where you need to go for further information. I have set up this website as a way to try and condense all the
                    information available into one place.
                    <br /><br />
                    Please note that the information provided in this website is for help and estimation purposes only. In this hobby things can
                    be more variable. Use this site and calculators for gudance purposes only.

                        When thinking about or setting up a marine tank, you need to think about what stock you would like to put in the tank.
                        Each type of animal has it's own needs. For example, are you want to go for a soft coral or hard coral dominant tank?
                        Each type of coral requires different things. Most hard corals require high light levels and steady water parameters,
                        whereas soft corals are much more tolerant to low light and variable water parameters.
                        <br /><br />
                        When selecting fish, care must be taken to select compatible fish. You would not want to put a small goby in with a
                        ferocious lion fish as it will be so long little goby. Likewise, you would not want to put a puffer fish in with other
                        fish in case it puffs out and poisons the water. Only certain fish can tolerate it's poison within an enclosed area.
                        <br /><br />
                        Use the fish stock calculator to work out how many fish you can have in a given tank size.

                    Now comes the more in-depth information that you need to know. Water parameters are key to successfully keeping you tank
                    healthy and having very happy inhabitants. Everything from temperature and the salinity of the water to trace heavy
                    metals can all have an effect on the tank. One important thing to remember is that you have animals within an enclosed
                    space with water that doesn't change much. Unlike the oceans and seas where there is a constant water turn over and the
                    water surrounding animals is cleansed through current movements and dilution, you do not have this luxury and so need
                    to control water parameters tightly.
                    <br /><br />
                    You are probably thinking right now that maybe this is not for me. But don't be disheartened! With a little work and
                    constant vigilance, you can make this a successful hobby.

                        The most important water parameters that need to be monitored are salinity, nitorgenous materials such as ammonia and nitrates,
                        phosphates, pH and temperature.
                        <br><br />
                        Temperature can be easily controlled with the use of an accurate thermometer and reliable heater. Salinity can be also controlled
                        relatively easily with a refractometer (or the less reliable hydrometer), water changes using the calulations obtained using the
                        salinity calculators and an auto-top up system. It is extremely important to get salinity correct with no sharp increases or decreases.
                        These can adversely effect your tank stock.
                        <br><br />
                        It is crucial that ammonia is controlled. This can be lethal to your inhabitants if there is too much or they are exposed to it over
                        an extended period. Ammonia should be regularly checked using the readily availble kits out there. Providing you have sufficient
                        filtration (either through live rock or mechanical filters) ad yu keep up with regular water changes, then ammonia should not be a
                        problem.

                <p>
                    Nitrates and nitrites are produced as a result of the successful breakdown of ammonia through efficient filtration. Although not harmful
                    (at low concentratons) it can cause unsightly algae to grow all over the tank. This can block out the light used by your corals eventually
                    killing them and will make the tank extremely unpleasant to view. Phosphates are another product that can cause unwanted algae to grow.
                    Just like ammonia, this can be monitored using test kits and can be reduced with effective water changes.
